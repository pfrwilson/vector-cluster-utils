Helpful bash and python library for the vector cluster.

For additional cluster help resources, we go to [vector support wiki](https://support.vectorinstitute.ai/), [vector cluster FAQ](https://support.vectorinstitute.ai/Computing?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=Vector+Vaughan+HPC+Changes+FAQ+2023.pdf) and also look at the vector slack channel.
